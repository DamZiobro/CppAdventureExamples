This article quickly presents another new C++11 standard feauters - constexpr keyword.  <br /<br />>
constexpr keyword allows explicitly make functions, variables or object constructors articulted as constant expressions. <br /><br />

For understanding take a look on below example:

Output of that example is:

Point I of above example presents usage function return result as constant expression. Until now (until C++03 standard) 
such line of code made compilation error. It was because return_three() function is not constant expression by default (it was suspition that 
function return different values in different places compile time). C++11 changes it. We can use constexpr keyword at the beginning of function defintion 
and define mark it as constant expression (point II) if such function returns constant values in each places during compilation time. <br /><br />

Point III presents how to declare variable as constant expression. Until now we was able to declare variable as constant. However as we know constant 
expression can sometimes change when user casts it using const_cast operator (avoid it!!! it is evil!!!). constexpr keyword make sure that such 
variable will be constant during compilation time. <br /><br />

Point IV presents usage of class object like constant expression. In order to create object of user-defined classes as constract expression, constructor 
of such object has to be marked using constexpr keywork and have to be empty body (look at point V). Otherwise you will see compilation error. 

That's it. I hope you was able to understand constexpr C++11's feature more deeply. Code of above example you can find in our GitHub account as usual:
