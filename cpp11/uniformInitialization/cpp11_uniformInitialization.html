C++11 standard provides new form of objects initialization which makes such initialization uniform for different structs and classes and 
simplify objects construction and initialization process. Thanks to the new process we can initialize many different classes using the same 
syntax. <br /><br />

Please take a look on the example below:

Output of this example is:

In point I we are initializing class of two different objects using C++11 uniform initialization mechanism. On object is created based on 
struct type (pure struct type without any method - look point II). The second one is created based on MyClass class constructor. <br /><br />

As you can see, despite that we are creating objects of two totally different types, those objects can be created the same way (uniform way).
This is just uniform unitialization featuere provided in C++11 standard. <br /><br />

Below we are initializating MyStruct object using external function getMyStruct(). You can take a look to the body of that function (point IV).
As you can see we are implicitly using uniform initialization form of struct MyStruct inside getMyStruct() function to create object.<br /><br />

However you need to be careful with using uniform initialization for classes having <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/c11-initializer-lists.html">initializer_list</a> constructor. 
In such case, initializer list constructor has higher priority than uniform initialization and constructor will be used instead of uniform initialization.
So be aware of it and enjoy your C++11 programming :) <br /><br />
