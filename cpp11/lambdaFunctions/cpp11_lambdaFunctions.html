C++11 standard introduces new type of functions for C++ programming - lambda functions. <br /><br />

<i>Lambda function is a anonymous (unnamed) function which you can write directly inline in the code.</i><br /><br />

Lambda function allows do some operations visible like a function without declaring it as a function (saving space and time). <br /><br />

C++ lambda function has following syntax:
<center>[capture](arguments){body}</center>
<ul>
    <li>capture - value which should be captured outside of body class</li>
    <li>arguments - list of arguments of function (the same syntax as for normal C++ functions)</li>
    <li>body - body of function - statements which should be exectued when function is invoked</li>
</ul>

For better understanding take a look fo below example:

Output of this example is:

In point I we are initializing vector using C++11 <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/c11-initializer-lists.html">initializer_list</a><br /><br />

Point II is key point of our example. It demonstrate using lambda function (3rd argument of for_each function) together with with <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/for_each">for_each</a> algorithm of STL library
in order to calculate sum of vector elements. In C++03 we had to define separate function (outside of our main function) in order to us it within some STL algorithm
(ex. for_each as in this example). Thanks to lambda functions we can define such us such function without declaration - in place. It is definitely easier
especially if we are going to use some small function once in our code.<br /><br />

In point III we are printing results of our calculations.<br /><br />

As you can see, lambda functions are very comfortable when you are going to use some small function only once withing your code (ex. calculate some sum).<br />
