This article presents how to avoid problem of <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/c-multithreading-race-conditions.html">Race conditions</a> described in <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/c-multithreading-race-conditions.html">this</a> article. <br /><br />

As we already know race conditions can occur when two or more threads are trying to invoke some part of 
code or use the same resource (ex. variable) at the time. That can cause problem of unexpected results. We 
could see that problem in <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/c-multithreading-race-conditions.html">'Race conditions'</a> 
article where two threads was able to modify the same variable <font face="courier">value</font> which caused 
different program output every time we invoked it. <br /><br />

In order to avoid that problem we should synchronize operations of our threads using multithreading mechanism 
called <b>mutexes</b> (abbr. <i>Mutual exclusion</i>). Mutex is some kind of program flow control lock which 
which is able to make sure that some part of code locked by itself can be invoked by only one thread at the same 
time. Such locked part of code is called <b>critical section</b>. <br /><br />

When other thread will try to go into critical section it will be blocked and will need to wait until previous 
thread will unlock mutex of that critical section. <br /><br />

For better understanding that mechanism let's take a look on 'Race conditions' example code containing mechanism 
of mutexes to avoid race condition problem:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/a4437e27f9105e0e406b.js"></script>
Output of that code is (always the same):
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/1a43c0eec656217832db.js"></script>

You can invoke that code few times and you will see that output of that example is always the same right now. 
It is because of synchronization mechanism. Let's analyze our synchronization mechanism using mutexes. <br /><br />

In point I we are declaring variable <font face="courier">increment_mutex</font> which is our mutex used for synchronization. <br /><br />

Now take a look on point II and III. As you know from previous article our race condition is caused by 
increment of variable <font face="courier">value</font> in two threads. We sould put such incrementation into 
critical section locked by our mutex <font face="courier">increment_mutex</font>. <br /><br />

<font face="courier">mutex</font> type has functions <b><font face="courier">lock()</font></b> and <b><font face="courier">unlock()</font></b>
which could be start point and end point of critical section. We could invoke <font face="courier">increment_mutex.lock()</font>
to start critical section and <font face="courier">increment_mutex.unlock</font> to finish critical section. This is enough 
mechanism for synchronization our mechanism of incrementation. Notice commented critical sections in point II and III. 

However, better method of creating critical section in C++11 code is using <b><font face="courier">lock_guard</font></b> mechanism.
That mechanism uses RAII idiom which allows to create critical section start in the place of creating <font face="courier">lock_guard</font>
typed variable. End point of such critical section is end of scope where such variable is defined (most often it is 
nearest close curly bracket sign '}' as in our situation). Such lock_guard object invokes <font face="courier">mutex.lock()</font> function in 
constructur of itself and <font face="courier">mutex.unlock()</font> function in the destructor of itself. Thanks to that 
we do not need to remember close critical section initialized by mutex. Non closing critical section could cause problem 
of deadlock which will be described in one of next articles. <br /><br />

Right now we have good working synchronized multithreaded program. Output is always the same which is expected. 
However, notice that our program works slower right now. Let's analyze time of working our application using 
Linux's <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time.7.html"><font face="courier">time</font></a> command for 
previous (containing race conditions) and current application (synchronized). 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/f676dab9bade4693458e.js"></script>

<b>Why is synchronized application slower?</b> The answer is simple. Because there is high possibility that two threads
working in parallel <b><i>will have to wait</i></b> each other before go to critical section. As I describe above 
when one thread is going to go into critical section (<font face="courier">mutex.lock()</font> function) which is 
locked by other thread it needs to wait for thread to exit such critical section (<font face="courier">mutex.unlock()</font> function). 
Sum of such <i>waitings</i> causes that application is slower. <br /><br />

Code of above application can be found as usual on our GitHub account here:
