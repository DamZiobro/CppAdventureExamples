C++11 standard introduces integrated sublibrary for multithreading. It has been moved from boost library. However because multithreading is very important 
topic in software development I decided to make multithreading tutorial as separate section of this blog. <br /><br />

I will not explain here what multithreading is theory about multithreading, but I will try to explain usage of multithreading based on thread library from
C++11 standard. If theory explanation will be required for some aspects I will try to put links to separate articles explaining them. <br /><br />

Introduction theory about multithreading you can find on Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(software)#Multithreading">here</a><br /><br />

This article will present basic threads creation and usage in C++. Code of example you can find here:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/8289200.js"></script>

Output of the example is (it can be little other - depends how thread will be invoked by OS): 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/8289230.js"></script>

In point I we are creating new thread where print() function will be invoked. This thread will work parallelly to 
the main function (main application is second thread called main thread)<br /><br />

Point II shows printing values using for loop invoked from main thread. <br /><br />

Point III is invoking function join() which will wait until thread1 will finish. This is basic synchronization. Without that function 
there is possible that we will receive termination error if main tread finished and thread1 did not finished its job. <br /><br />

If we do not want to wait until thread1 will finish and do not want to receive termination error we could use detach() function (look point IV). 
Thanks to that function thread1 will be detached from our main applicatin and will work in the background as deamon thread. We will be able to operate 
our next function without waiting for its finish if we do not need it. <br /><br />

This is first basic tutorial which presents how to create basic thread to run two separate function in parallel. In next multithreading articles I will show 
how to pass parameters for multithreading functions, return values, synchronize variables between threads and other thread releated topics. <br /><br />
