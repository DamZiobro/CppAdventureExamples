In the <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/c-multithreading-passing-parameters-to.html">previous C++ Multithreading article</a> I presented 
how to pass parameters between threads for you. Take a detail look on the output of that example once again: <br /><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/10403636.js"></script>

In the first line of that output you can notice that output text from two threads is mixed. You are probably wondering why it happens? <br /><br />

It is because we are not protecting resources which are shared by two threads (in this example cout stream is shared in both threads) which causes 
multithreading's phenomenon called <i><b>race condition</b></i>. <br /><br />

Because threads switching and accessing to shared members are managed by operating system we do not know when std::cout stream will be accessed by main 
thread and when it will be accessed by second thread. Therefore in the previous article I mentioned that output of the example can be little different on 
your computer than my output example. What's more it is possible that this output will be different for few consecutive invoking of the example on 
the same machine. It is because of race condition access to std::cout between main thread and second thread. <br /><br />

In theory, <i><b>race condition</b> is any situation where output of some operation (ex. function return) depends on relative ordering of execution of some 
    operations on two or more threads</i>. It is one of the biggest problems during multithreading-based programming. <br /><br /> 

For better understanding race conditions take a look on another example below: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/10479195.js"></script>

Try to compile and invoke that example few times on your computer. What is a result? Are you suprised? <br />
On my computer three invokings of that examples returned three different results: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/10479360.js"></script>

It is of course because of race condition. Let's analyse that example step by step to understand why race conditions occurs here. <br /><br />

In point I we are creating  <font face="courier">intValue</font> variable which will be shared and increased in both threads in parallel. <br /><br />

Operation in point II should be known. We are creating new thread here. One news here is that we are pushing <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/advanced-c-function-object.html">http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/advanced-c-function-object.html</a>
instead of <i>normal</i> function as thread function which will be invoked in parallel. One more interesting thing which you should notice in this 
instruction is <b>additional pair of brackets</b> around <font face="courier">ThreadClass()</font>. Those additional brackets have to be use in the situation where we 
are passing function object to thread creating function in order to avoid ambiguity with invoking function which takes one parameter (pointer to the 
function which takes no parameters and returns ThreadClass object) and returns <font face="courier">std::thread</font> type object rather than creating new thread.
It is little complicated but rethink it and you should understand <br /><br />

In point III and IIIa we are invoking loop which increases intValue variable in parallel (in main thread and in parallel thread because we passed it by reference). 
That sharing intValue in both threads causes race condition here which causes different outputs for another invoking of our application. 
Let's take a detailed look at it. <br /><br />

Remember that we are in multithreaded environment where things happens in parallel. Two for loop (from two threads) works in parallel and we have intValue shared between threads.
Because threads are managed by operating system we do not know when (after which instruction) operating of for loop from main thread is switched to 
operating second thread. <br /> 

Now consider following situation. We have following statement: <br />
<font face="courier">intValue = intValue + 1</font> <br />
That statement consist of 3 steps in the background:
<ul>
    <li>read value of <font face="courier">intValue</font> and store it in temporary variable <font face="courier">tmp</font></li> 
    <li>increase value of <font face="courier">tmp</font> by 1</li>
    <li>write value of tmp to <font face="courier">intValue</font></li>
</ul>
Everything is ok when we have one thread application because those steps are invoked sequentially. However for multithreaded application there is possible following 
sequence of steps. 
Assume that <font face="courier">intValue == 100</font>
<ul>
    <li>thread1 reads value of <font face="courier">intValue</font>and stores it in <font face="courier">tmp1 (tmp1 == 100)</font></li>
    <li>thread2 reads value of <font face="courier">value</font> (which is reference to value so basically it is the same variable as intValue) and stores it in 
        <font face="courier">tmp2 (tmp2 == 100)</font></li>
    <li>thread1 increase value of <font face="courier">tmp1</font> by 1 <font face="courier">(tmp1 == 101)</font></li>
    <li>thread2 increase value of <font face="courier">tmp2</font> by 1 <font face="courier">(tmp2 == 101)</font></li>
    <li>thread1 writes value of <font face="courier">tmp1</font> into <font face="courier">intValue (intValue == 101)</font></li>
    <li>thread2 writes value of <font face="courier">tmp2</font> into value <font face="courier">value (value == 101)</font></li>
</ul>
We got it. Can you see problem with race condition right now? We expected increment of intValue two times while it was applied only once in such situation! <br /><br />

As you can imaging such such situation can occur many many times while our loop has 1000000 steps. Of course it sometimes occures and sometimes we have normal 
sequential invocation (depends how operating system switches threads). Therefore we receive other results when we invoke our application many times. I hope you got it.  <br /><br />

Of course such ambiguous output cause by race conditions is undesirable and it is programmer's work to make it unambiguous. Some technique how to synchronize usage of shared 
resources between threads will be presented in next C++11 Multithreading article. <br /><br />

I encourage you to think and write some other examples when race conditions can occur and experiment with them for better undestanding that very important phenomenon of 
multithreading programming.
