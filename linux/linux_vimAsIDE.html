In this post I would like to present you my configuration of <i>vim text editor</i> as Integrated Development Environment (IDE). <br /><br />

In my daily work I am not using big IDE environments like Eclipse, NetBeans or other. Instead, I am using vim text editor configured with number of plugins, which contains all of most important features of traditional IDE environment and additionally I don't need to resign with VIM advantages like speed and flexibility.  <br /><br />

Using that VIM as IDE configuration I comfortably work with following programming languages on the daily basis:
<ul>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Bash</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>

My <b>VIM as IDE</b> configuration is publically available in github. You can clone it from here:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/xmementoit/vim-ide
</pre>

It is under continous development so you can expect adding new features in the future.<br /><br />

Video presentation of main features of my VIM as IDE environment can be found on youtube:  <br />

I am aware that starting with big VIM as IDE configuration can be difficult at the beginning. Therefore, before you will use VIM as IDE extensively, I strongly recommend to learn VIM basics before. Especially, I encourage to spend some time with this <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/" target="_blank">Learn VIM Progressively tutorial</a> <br /><br />

Good luck with your VIM adventure !!
