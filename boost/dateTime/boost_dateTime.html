Today I would like to present you operations related to date and time using Boost.DateTime library. This library contains set of 
classes, templates and algorithms prepared for date and time related tasks. This article focuses on date operations. Time operations will be presented 
in one of the future articles. <br /><br />

Example of usage some basic Boost.DateTime date operations you can see here:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/8219144.js"></script>

Output of this example is (for day 3 January 2014):
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/8219156.js"></script>

All below operations will be based on boost::gregorian namespace. We created alias <i>dateTime</i> for this namespace for more convenient use.<br /><br />

In point I we are using universal_day() method for getting current day accroding to UTC timezone. Of course output of this and other date-related 
functions depends on date of invoking. Therefore you will get other output of your appliation every other day you will invoke it. <br />
universal_day() function returns date class object which has lot of functions for date manipulation and displaying. <br /><br />

In point II we are using months class object to add one month to our current date. Thanks to overloading operator+() you can add date and months 
class objects and iterate through next and previous months. If you will add one month to the date 1-Jan-2014 you will receive 1-Feb-2014. However if you will 
add one month to date 31-Jan-2013 you will receive 28-Feb-2013 (because all dates are end days of consecutive months).<br /><br />

In point III we are using date_from_iso_string() method for conversion string formated as "YYYYMMDD" to date class and display its value to standard 
output. <br /><br />

Point IV presents data_duration object which allow you calculate time intervals. We are using two our date objects today and myBirthdayDate to calculate 
interval of live of person who was birth at 30-Jun-1985. Then we are using days() method of date_duration class to present calculated interval as number of 
days.<br /><br />

Point V present how to iterate through consecutive days using day_iterator class and overloaded operator++() operator. As you can see this iteration 
is adequate to mechanism of <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/stl-iterators-mechanism.html">iteration between consecutive elements of STL containers</a>. Thanks to that we have intuitive way to iterate throgh dates, too. <br /><br />

Of course DateTime library has more useful functions to operate on dates. Lots of details and examples you can find on the offical Boost.DateTime library documentation 
site here: <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/date_time/examples.html">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/date_time/examples.html</a> <br /><br />
