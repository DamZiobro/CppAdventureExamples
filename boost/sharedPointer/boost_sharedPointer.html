Shared pointer is another kind of Boost library's pointer. It is similar to <a href="http://cppadventure.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/boost-scoped-pointer.html">scoped pointer</a> but shared pointer allows 
share ownership of object. We are able to assign two or more pointers pointing to the same object (it was impossible for scoped pointer).<br /><br />

Take a look to the example below:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/8052343.js"></script>

Output of this example is: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/8052388.js"></script>

In point I we are initializing two shared pointers pointing to two separate instances of TestClass class, then we are printing 
its values in point II.<br /><br />

Point III shows use difference between shared pointer and scoped pointer. We are assigning two pointers to the same 
object of class TestClass. In this point object having testValue==5 is being destroyed (because we remove the only one pointer to that object).
Also, we have two pointers pointing to objects having testValue==6 now. Note that that object will be destroyed when last 
shared pointer pointing to them will be destroyed (int our case it is destroyed when we are reaching end of main() function).
This is key difference between scoped pointer and shared pointer.<br /><br />

In point IV we are printing testValues of objects which are being pointed by our both scoped pointers. Actually, it is the same object 
so we are getting value 6 in both cases.<br /><br />
