<strong>Template class</strong> concept is similar to template functions. It allows creating generic type classes, which means that we can 
have many different classes which different only in terms of types using one class code only. <br /><br />

See example below for better explanation:<br />

Output of this example is: <br />

Point I depicts definition of template class. As you can see it is very similar to definition of template function. We are defining myType as type
which will be replaced with real type during usage of template class. Then we are defining class normally with usage of mapped temporary type.<br /><br />

Points II and III shows how to use template class for different class. We are defining two instances of our template class - for int and double types. 
Compiler will implicitely generate bodies of two clases based on those types and template definition. As for template functions, we are selecting real type 
using angle brackets.<br /><br />
