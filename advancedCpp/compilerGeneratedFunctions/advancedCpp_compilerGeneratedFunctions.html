When we define some class in our C++ code, compiler is generating some important functions for our class (unless we define it explicitly). 
Those functions (sometimes called Compiled Generated Functions) are:
 - default constructor 
 - destructor
 - copy constructor 
 - copy assignment operator 
During compilation compiler know our code and class usage and when we are using one of above functions implicitly it generate that function implicitly for us in the class body.
For better explenation, let's see the example below:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/6726064.js"></script>
In point I we are defining class TestClass. This class seems to be empty. However in main class we are implicitly using following following function:
 - point III - we are implicitly using defualt constructor in order to create instance of TestClass - default constructor of TestClass is implicitly generated by compiler
 - point IV  - we are using copy constructor of TestClass in order to copy instance to instance2 - copy constructor of TestClass is implicitly generated by compiler
 - point V   - we are using copy assignment operator of TestClass in order to copy instance2 to instance3 - copy assignment operator of TestClass is implicitly generated by compiler 
 - point VI  - destructor of TestClass is implicitly being used - destructor of TestClass is implicitly generated by compiler 
Because above functions are explicitly generated by compiler our class looks as in point II. 
However if (for example) we remove line with point V, compiler will detect that we are not using copy assignment operator of TestClass in our code and will not generate that function for TestClass. So compiler generates only those Compiler Generated Functions which we are using in our code.
We can also explicitly switch off generating some of Compiled Generated Functions using default and delete C++11 keywords as described in this article.
