<b>Stack unwinding</b> is normally a concept of removing function entries from <i>call stack</i> (also known as Execution stack, Control stack, 
Function stack or Run-time stack). Call Stack is a stack data structure that stores active functions' addresses and helps in supporting function 
call/return mechanism. Every time when a function is called, an entry is made into Call stack which contains the return address of the calling function 
where the control needs to return after the execution of called function. This entry is called by various names like <b>stack frame</b>, activation frame or 
activation record. <br /><br />

With respect to exception handling, stack Unwinding is a process of linearly searching function call stack to reach exception handler. 
When an exception occurs, if it is not handled in current function where it is thrown, the function Call Stack is unwound until the control 
reaches try block and then passes to catch block at the end of try block to handle exception. <br />
Also, in this process, it takes care to free memory used from stack. <br /><br />

Let us see an example to understand how this happens: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/10295023.js"></script>
<br />

<i>Output1</i> (When exception is not thrown ): 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/10294959.js"></script>
<br />

<i>Output2</i> (When exception is thrown):
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/10294897.js"></script>
<br />


Check from <i>Output1</i> that in case of normal execution (without exceptions), Stack unwinding happens from the top i.e latest function call and also 
Destructor of each object in each function is called when the execution of function completes.<br /><br />

Check from <i>Output2</i> that when exception is thrown, each called function terminates abruptly instead of returning to calling function normally. 
Note that in this case also, program frees stack memory and continues freeing the stack until it reaches exception handler. 
This process is called as stack unwinding. <br /><br />
